<main class="typo"><div><h1>Accessibility Myths</h1><section><h2>Accessibility only affects a small group of users</h2><p>Not that small. Around <strong>15%</strong> of the world&#39;s population, or estimated
<strong>1 billion</strong> people, live with disabilities, they are the world&#39;s largest minority. The number
of people with disability is dramatically increasing.</p><a href=https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health>More details
<span>about Accessibility only affects a small group of users</span></a></section><section><h2>Disabled users don&#39;t use my website</h2><p>How can you be so sure? Many people with disabilities like color blindness, limited motor skills, etc. use
websites just like other users. Also, many
<strong>assistive technologies are not detectable</strong> in any way.</p><a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/>More details <span>about Disabled users don&#39;t use my website</span></a></section><section><h2>Making a website accessible is costly and time-consuming</h2><p>It may not be the case if accessibility is considered from the beginning of the project and a development
team has proper skills. When accessibility has become a habit, the
<strong>development time doesn&#39;t change</strong> or changes a little.</section><section><h2>We can quickly add accessibility before the release</h2><p>Won&#39;t work. Maybe easy things such as alternative text or form labeling may be added at the end, but some
<strong>complex UX should be planned to be accessible</strong>. In some cases, making features accessible at
the end of development process may require the full refactoring.</section><section><h2>Accessibility is only about adding alternative text to images</h2><p>In fact, missing alternative text for images is
<a href=https://webaim.org/projects/million/>one of the biggest accessibility issues</a>.
But besides this, there are many things to be considered while making accessible website -
<strong>headline structure</strong>, <strong>functional controls</strong>,
<strong>color contrast</strong> and much more.</section><section><h2>Web accessibility is just a developer&#39;s responsibility</h2><p>It&#39;s a team effort. <strong>Designers</strong> create accessible UIs, <strong>developers</strong> build it,
<strong>QA engineers</strong> do the accessibility testing, <strong>PMs</strong> make sure that
accessibility is included in the team processes, <strong>legal team</strong> checks if a product is risk
free from an accessibility perspective, <strong>content managers</strong> adjust content to be compliant.</p><a href=https://accessibility.digital.gov/>More details <span>about Web accessibility is just a developer&#39;s job</span></a></section><section><h2>Accessibility only helps people with disabilities</h2><p>Fortunately <strong>it helps everyone</strong>. It&#39;s a known fact that applying accessibility principles
improves overall user experience and makes a website more convenient to use.</section><section><h2>Making websites accessible doesn&#39;t bring any additional benefits</h2><p>To list just a few of them - more users, more revenue, better reputation, less risks to be sued, better
competence of development teams and many more. At the end doing
<strong>a good thing</strong> doesn&#39;t always have to require a profitable reason.</section><section><h2>Accessibility can be fixed by the accessibility overlay</h2><p>Absolutely no. There is an
<a href=https://overlayfactsheet.com/>initiative</a>
signed by hundreds of professionals which advocates the removal of the web accessibility overlay.</section><section><h2>Using automated tools is all I need to do to make my website accessible</h2><p>That would be easy, but no. Usually automated accessibility testing can only find
<a href=https://marcysutton.com/evinced-automated-accessibility-testing>30-50% of all accessibility issues</a>. In fact, some websites
<a href=https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/>can be built in a way</a>
that automated tests will pass even though the website is totally inaccessible.</section><section><h2>Accessibility is only for blind users</h2><p>Certainly, accessibility affects the experience of blind users, but it also users with other visual
disabilities such as color blindness. And of course, it also benefits people with other forms of disability,
related to hearing, mobility, speech or cognition. It also works for elderly users. In short, for all users.
It is <strong>essential for some but useful for all</strong>.</p><a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/>More details <span>about Accessibility is only for blind users</span></a></section><section><h2>Accessibility is optional</h2><p>Until your company got sued. Learn about the
<a href=https://www.nad.org/2011/06/16/nad-files-disability-civil-rights-lawsuit-against-netflix/>Netflix</a>
and
<a href=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/07/dominos-supreme-court.html>Domino</a>
cases to understand that the price for not being accessible may be too high. There are
<a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/>many laws</a>
that may require a website to be accessible.</section><section><h2>Accessibility is only about preventing lawsuits</h2><p>Accessibility is about your users. Of course, preventing lawsuits is important for any company, but
<strong>user satisfaction</strong> and <strong>company reputation</strong> bring a lot of value as well.</section><section><h2>Accessibility is only about following the WCAG</h2><p>Usually it starts from
<a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/>WCAG</a>, but in real life a compliant
website may still not be fully accessible. Accessibility is about understanding the need of all users as
well as about empathy and awareness.</section><section><h2>Accessibility can be achieved by only adding ARIA attributes</h2><p>Of course,
<a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/>ARIA</a>
is an important part of accessibility, but the golden rule of ARIA is
<a href=https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/#rule1>&#34;Don&#39;t Use ARIA&#34;</a>. Many ARIA attributes
may not be necessary if
<a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#good_semantics>semantic HTML</a>
tags are used.</section><section><h2>We don&#39;t need to be compliant</h2><p>Maybe you need. There are a number of laws and regulations which may require a website to follow
accessibility principles. It&#39;s definitely worth checking them.</p><a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/>More details <span>about We don&#39;t need to be compliant</span></a></section><section><h2>Only accessibility experts can implement accessibility fixes</h2><p>Luckily no. Everyone with some accessibility skills can implement and test websites for accessibility. In
fact, it&#39;s not only easy to learn, but sometimes it&#39;s quite a fun process. It doesn&#39;t require a specific
experience to run the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/>easy checks</a>.</section><section><h2>Accessibility is like a feature - you do it once and then you have it</h2><p>Accessibility is a practice, not a feature. It means that one should take care of it regularly, both when
working on features or doing maintenance work. The knowledge about accessibility should be passed on when a
new team member joins or when requirement changes.</p><a href=https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/accessibility-is-not-a-feature/>More details
<span>about Accessibility is like a feature - you do it once and then you have it</span></a></section><section><h2>Accessibility can be fixed by providing a separate website version for disabled people</h2><p>That was the wrong assumption back then. Since that time, many development teams have
<strong>learned the hard way</strong> that maintaining several versions of the website and keeping all the
content up to date <strong>costs much more</strong> than creating the only one fully accessible website.</section><section><h2>People with disabilities don&#39;t use the web</h2><p>That&#39;s wrong. In fact, in some cases internet is
<strong>the only way</strong> how disabled people can communicate to the world. Also, where &#34;abled people&#34;
use their natural feelings such as sight and hearing,
<strong>people with disabilities must rely on technologies</strong>.</p><a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/>More details <span>about People with disabilities don&#39;t use the web</span></a></section><section><h2>Blind people don&#39;t watch movies</h2><p>They definitely do. With the help of
<strong>audio descriptions</strong> they can watch and listen to any media content as all other people do.</p><a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/description/>More details <span>about Blind people don&#39;t watch movies</span></a></section><section><h2>Accessibility can only be tested by disabled people</h2><p>Well, usually disabled people are the best testers - they use assistive technologies full time. However,
<strong>everyone can learn</strong> how to test websites for accessibility.</p><a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/>More details
