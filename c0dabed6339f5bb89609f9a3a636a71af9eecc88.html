It includes getting 7-9 hours of sleep, building a sleep rhythm, getting morning sunlight, exercising in the morning, controlling caffeine intake, catching the evening sun, setting dark mode, expecting the spike, and keeping cool.<br/>-------<br/><br/>I used to wake up tired every morning.<br/><br/>This 9-step sleep routine saved my life (Based on science): <br/><br/><br/><br/>1 - Get Your Hours In<br/><br/>I aim for 7-9 hours of sleep every night.<br/><br/>Studies show that less than 7 hours a night leads to:<br/><br/>1. Depression<br/>2. Weight gain<br/>3. Heart disease<br/><br/>Instead of obsessing about an exact amount, experiment &amp; see where between 7-9 hours has you feeling your best.<br/><br/>2 - Build a Sleep Rhythm<br/><br/>Sleep &amp; wake up at the same time every day.<br/><br/>This allows adenosine (the chemical that makes you feel sleepy) to make you feel awake &amp; sleepy at the right times.<br/><br/>How to build a rhythm:<br/><br/>1. Set an alarm<br/>2. Socialise earlier<br/>3. Don&#39;t sleep in on weekends<br/><br/>3 - Start with Sunlight.<br/><br/>Another system that makes you feel awake &amp; sleepy is your internal clock.<br/><br/>Morning sunlight triggers this internal clock to make you feel awake in the morning &amp; sleepy 12-14 hours after exposure.<br/><br/>Aim for 10-30 minutes of sunlight every morning.<br/><br/>4 - Morning Exercise.<br/><br/>Exercise releases chemicals called endorphins which make you feel awake.<br/><br/>Exercising in the morning can also trigger your body to anticipate it &amp; make you feel even more awake.<br/><br/>Any type of exercise works:<br/><br/>1. Walking<br/>2. Running<br/>3. Lifting weights<br/><br/>5 - Caffeine Control.<br/><br/>Caffeine blocks the sleepy chemical (Adenosine) receptors that make you feel tired. <br/><br/>It can take 5-6 hours for just 50% of caffeine to leave your system &amp; even longer to be completely gone.<br/><br/>Try to stop drinking caffeine 8-12 hours before your bedtime.<br/><br/>6 - Catch The Evening Sun.<br/><br/>Since the sunlight is dim in the evening, getting in direct sunlight tells your internal clock that it‚Äôs almost time to go to bed.<br/><br/>Do this every day to help you build your sleep rhythm.<br/><br/>7 -Set Dark Mode.<br/><br/>Bright lights at night mimic sunlight &amp; will trigger your body to think it‚Äôs time to feel awake.<br/><br/>A few ways I avoid these bright lights are:<br/><br/>1. Using lowlights<br/>2. Using my Kindle instead of phone<br/>3. Avoiding computer use after 10 pm<br/><br/>8 - Expect the Spike.<br/><br/>You naturally have a spike in wakefulness 1 hour before your bedtime.<br/><br/>Instead of getting stressed when this happens, remember it will fade &amp; continue on with your routine.<br/><br/>I‚Äôve found reading a book helps me stay relaxed through this.<br/><br/>9 - Keep your Cool.<br/><br/>Your body temperature needs to drop by 1-3 degrees in order to fall &amp; stay asleep.<br/><br/>If you have air conditioning, set it between 16-19 degrees at night.<br/><br/>If not, open a window or pick up a cheap fan.<br/><br/>The 9-step sleep routine that saved my life:<br/><br/>1. Get Your Hours In<br/>2. Build a Sleep Rhythm<br/>3. Start with Sunlight<br/>4. Morning Exercise<br/>5. Caffeine Control<br/>6. Catch the Evening Sun<br/>7. Set Dark Mode<br/>8. Expect the Spike<br/>9. Keep your Cool<br/><br/>If you enjoyed this thread you&#39;d probably enjoy checking out the full video on this on my YouTube channel:<br/><br/><a href="https://t.co/VlEP97snhi">https://t.co/VlEP97snhi</a></p></div></div></div></div>
